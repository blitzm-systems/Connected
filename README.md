# Connected Fastlane Plugin

[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-connected)

## About connected

A fastlane plugin that uses your app store connect api key to upload apps to TestFlight and install provisioning profiles. This plugin interacts with a 3rd party ruby App Store Connect sdk (https://github.com/kyledecot/app_store_connect).

This plugin has [3 actions](lib/fastlane/plugin/connected/actions)

- **connected_auth**

  - Initialises app store connect api session
  - You MUST execute this action before you can use any other actions
  - Example (requires CONNECT_API_KEY, CONNECT_KEY_ID and CONNECT_KEY_ISSUER_ID in your env variables)
    ```ruby
    connected_auth
    ```

- **connected_certs**

  - Fetches all of the provisioning profiles for a given app id, installs them and their certificates
  - Requires you to have created your provisioning profile for your app manually in the Apple Developer Portal
  - Example
    ```ruby
    connected_certs(
      app_id: 'com.company.app'
    )
    ```

- **connected_upload**

  - Uploads yourÂ `.ipa` file to TestFlight
  - Example if you used gym to compile your app
    ```ruby
    connected_upload(
      ipa_file: lane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]
    )
    ```

* Please post requests for new features for this plugin as it is still very barebones.
